<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project involves building a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and attend events. Events take place at a specific date and at a location. The project involves working with two models- the User and Event models are as described below.

`User Model
`
<br /><br />
This User model is used to hold information of every single member of the site. The model stores users information in its username and email fields. Users can create and attend events. A user can create and attend many events.

`Event model
`
<br /><br />
This model is used to hold information of every event. It stores information in title, description,location and date fields.
